He modelled himself on The Shadows, then Bob Dylan then Jimi Hendrix. Daniel''s father insisted that he study catering instead of music. In 1967, while on a catering course in Benodet he met Alan Stivell who invited him to join his group.[1] Alan Stivell and his musicians embraced Breton, Scottish, Irish music, and included Gabriel Yacoub who later formed Malicorne. After a successful tour in France in 1972 they travelled around Europe, North America and Australia. Alan''s father had made a reconstruction of the ancient Breton harp in 1953 and Alan learned to play the harp, bagpipes and Irish flute. Daniel Le Bras changed his name to Dan Ar Bras to show that he belonged to Breton culture rather than French.

His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band.[4] Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.<p>\r\n<p>Alan''s first recording came in 1960 ("Musique gaelique"), a single that was followed by the LP Telenn Geltiek in 1964. He already recorded solo harp and harp backing singers in 1959 with Breiz ma bro ("Brittany my country") and a Mouez Breiz EP ("Voice of Brittany") with the female singer Andrea Ar Gouilh. His stage name, "Stivell", means "fountain" or "spring" in Breton. This name refers both to the Breton renewal and to his surname "Cochevelou" (an evolution of kozh stivelloÃ¹, "the old fountains").</p>', 'http://www.alan-stivell.com/', 'Alan_Stivell.gif', 14),

(8, 'Silly Wizard', 'scotish', 'Silly Wizard was a Scottish folk band that began forming in Edinburgh in 1970. The founder members were two like-minded university studentsâ€”Gordon Jones (guitar, bodhran, vocals, bouzouki, mandola) and Bob Thomas (guitar, mandolin, mandola, banjo, concertina). The as-yet-unnamed band was sometimes joined by thirteen-year-old schoolboy Johnny Cunningham (fiddle, viola, mandola, vocals), who began more extensive touring with the band in 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Career</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas credited the name of the band to a flatmate who was writing a book of children''s stories, and the group first performed as "Silly Wizard" in summer 1972. Chris Pritchard (vocals) replaced Bill Watkins (vocals, guitar) in 1972. From September 1972 until March 1974, the band organized the Saturday night bookings, and regularly performed at, the Triangle Folk Club in Edinburgh. In February 1973, vocalist Pritchard left the band and was replaced by Madelaine Taylor (guitar, bodhran, vocals). In October 1973, the band was signed to Transatlantic Records XTRA label. An album was recorded but before it could be released, Madelaine Taylor left the band in December 1973. The master tapes were subsequently lost and the album has never been released.</p>\r\n<p>Jones, Thomas, and Cunningham began touring as a trio in January 1974, and went on the first of many French tours in April 1974.\r\nThe band added Neil Adam (bass, harmonium) in September 1974 and Andy M. Stewart (vocals, tin whistle, tenor banjo) in December 1974. In March 1975, Silly Wizard began work on their next album. The band was then joined by Freeland Barbour (accordion, bouzouki) and Alastair Donaldson (bass, flute), who replaced Neil Adam in July 1975 when the latter decided to return to university. Their eponymous LP Silly Wizard was released on the XTRA label and the band began touring throughout the UK and Europe.</p>\r\n<p>In late 1976, Freeland Barbour left the band and was replaced by Johnny Cunningham''s younger brother, Phil Cunningham (accordion, tin whistle, harmonium, synthesizer, octave mandolin, vocals), then sixteen years old. At the same time Alastair Donaldson left and was replaced by Martin Hadden (bass, guitar, piano). This six-member lineup then recorded the band''s second LP, Caledonia''s Hardy Sons (Highway/Shanachie, 1978). Founding member Bob Thomas left just as the group began work on their third LP, So Many Partings (Highway/Shanachie, 1979).</p>\r\n<p>Cunningham departed the band for the U.S. in 1980 and was replaced for six months by Dougie MacLean of the Tannahill Weavers. MacLean had once been in a band with Andy Stewart and Martin Hadden, and contributed to Silly Wizard''s fourth album, Wild and Beautiful (Highway/Shanachie, 1981) before returning to the Tannahill Weavers. The last five tracks on Wild and Beautiful were often played as an opening set to their live performances.</p>\r\n<p>Silly Wizard played a variety of Scottish folk music, both instrumental and vocal, from fast jigs and reels to slow airs. While the majority of the items they played were traditional songs or tunes, the band did write many compositions of their own. Phil Cunningham generally wrote instrumental music centered on the accordion, and Stewart wrote several songs in a style often distinctly traditional. Once Stewart''s singing and the driving, impassioned instrumentals of the Cunningham brothers had established themselves at its centre, the group''s overall sound changed little until their final album, A Glint of Silver, which introduced the synthesizer as a prominent part of the band, giving them a slightly New Age sound.</p>\r\n<p>They continued recording until the late 1980s, when the band decided to dissolve after performing for seventeen years and releasing nine albums. The band played its final performance in Voorheesville, New York in April 1988. Johnny Cunningham died on December 15, 2003 in New York.\r\nIn Scots Trad Music Awards 2003 Silly Wizard were nominated for the best folk band award.</p>\r\n<p>Members of Silly Wizard played at Celtic Connections in February 2007.</p>\r\n<p>In December 2012, Silly Wizard will be inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.</p>\r\nOn 16 February 2012, speculation over the potential release of a re-mastered live album was laid to rest when Silly Wizard ''Live'' Again (BCD619) went on sale exclusively through bass player Martin Hadden''s company Birnam CD.

(12, 'Clannad', 'irish', 'Clannad  are an Irish band formed in 1970 in Gweedore, County Donegal. Their music has been variously described as bordering on folk and folk rock, traditional Irish, Celtic and New Age, often incorporating elements of an even broader spectrum of smooth jazz and Gregorian chant. After twelve years of success in the folk music industry, they shot to international recognition in 1982 with the release of the "Theme from Harry''s Game", becoming the most successful band in the Celtic music genre. They subsequently went on to bridge the gap between traditional Celtic music and pop music in the 1980s and 1990s with albums such as Macalla and Anam. Their records usually consist of traditional Gaelic ballads, New Age tracks that carry the groupâ€™s trademark of haunting vocal harmonies, mellow harp-based instrumentals and often upbeat pop-flavoured numbers. During their career they toured the world extensively and gained fans in every major territory. They have recorded in six different languages, most notably in Irish, and their record sales have exceeded the 15 million mark. They are also widely regarded as the band which, for the first time, put Irish traditional music and the Irish language on the world stage and paved the way for many other Irish artists.

(13, 'SeÃ¡n Ã“ Riada', 'irish', 'SeÃ¡n Ã“ Riada (1 August 1931 â€“ 3 October 1971), was a composer and perhaps the single most influential figure in the revival of Irish traditional music during the 1960s. He became a household figure in Ireland through his participation in CeoltÃ³irÃ­ Chualann, compositions, writings and broadcasts on the topic.</p>\r\n<h3>Early life</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Born John Reidy in Cork City, he was educated at St Finbarr''s College, Farranferris. He played the violin, piano and organ and studied the Greek and Latin classics at University College Cork, graduating in 1952. While at College, Ã“ Riada was the auditor of the UCC Philosophical Society. In the same year he became assistant director for Radio Ã‰ireann. He married Ruth Coughlan in 1953. During the evening he played piano with dance bands. In 1955 Ã“ Riada left his prestigious job, his wife and his newborn son Peadar, and moved to Italy and France, adopting a wild bohemian lifestyle. While studying composition under Aloys Fleischman he wrote avant-garde music. He drank heavily, and acquired a passion for expensive fast cars. Over the next ten years Ã“ Riada wrote several orchestral pieces called "Nomos." The third was left incomplete and some of the others took years to finish. None of them were publicly performed more than once. Ruth went in pursuit of her husband and found him living in poverty in Paris. She persuaded relatives to give them money and brought him back to Ireland, where he became musical director of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin for five years. At about this time he changed his name from John Reidy to SeÃ¡n Ã“ Riada, after giving the subject much thought. A much more accurate (indeed the above account includes many fallacies) and detailed account of the early years is given in Dr. TomÃ¡s Ã“ Canainn''s biography of Ã“ Riada.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mise Ã‰ire</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a classical composer Ã“ Riada''s real strength was for music of the theatre and film. In 1959 he scored a documentary film by George Morrison called Mise Ã‰ire (I am Ireland). It is about the founding of the Republic of Ireland. It has repeatedly been used in other documentaries and is available on CD, together with other film music - "Saoirse" (1960) and An Tine Bheo (The Living Fire). The recording is conducted by Ã“ Riada himself. These works combine traditional Irish tunes and "sean-nÃ³s" (old style) songs with an orchestral arrangement. Ralph Vaughan Williams had already done this sort of thing with English folk music, but in 1950s Ireland traditional music was still held in low regard by some elements of Irish society. His first attempt to combine Irish song with the classical tradition was in 1958 when an Irish radio station in Cork commissioned a short work. Mise Ã‰ire brought him national acclaim and allowed him to start a series of programmes on Irish radio called Our Musical Heritage. Ã“ Riada told people that one should listen to sean-nÃ³s song either as a child would listen or as if they were songs from India.</p>\r\n<h3>CeoltÃ³irÃ­ Chualann</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 1961 and 1969 Ã“ Riada was leader of a group called CeoltÃ³irÃ­ Chualann. Although they played in concert halls dressed in black suits with white shirts and black bow ties, they played traditional songs and tunes. An ordinary cÃ©ilidh band or show-band would have musicians who competed with each other to grab the attention of the audience. CeoltÃ³irÃ­ Chualann played sparse lucid arrangements. Ã“ Riada sat in the middle at front playing bodhrÃ¡n, a hand-held frame-drum. This was an instrument that had almost died out, being played only by small boys in street parades. CeilÃ­ bands generally had jazz-band drum-kits. Ã“ Riada also wanted to use the clarsach or wire-strung harp in the band, but as these were as yet unavailable, he played the harpsichord instead - the nearest sound to a clarsach. The harpsichord he used on a regular basis was made by Cathal Gannon. Unknown to Ã“ Riada, Irish folk music was being played ensemble-style in London pubs, but for most people of Ireland this was the first time they heard these tunes played by a band. The membership of CeoltÃ³irÃ­ Chualann overlapped with membership of The Chieftains, so it is surprising that the six albums they recorded are not better known. They recorded the soundtrack of the film "Playboy of the Western World" (original play by John Millington Synge) in 1963. Their last public performance was in 1969, and issued as the album "Ã“ Riada Sa Gaiety".</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Final years</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1964 Ã“ Riada moved to CÃºil Aodha in West Cork, an Irish-speaking area. He established CÃ³r ChÃºil Aodha, a male voice choir. He turned toward church choral music, including "Aifreann 2" (premiered posthumously in 1979). Other works include "Five Greek Epigrams" and "Holdlerin Songs." In 1996 Kate Bush recorded the Peadar Ã“ DoirnÃ­n lyric "MnÃ¡ na hÃ‰ireann," set to music by Sean Ã“ Riada and CeoltÃ³irÃ­ Chualann, for the compilation album "Common Ground." "MnÃ¡ na hÃ‰ireann," as performed by the Chieftains, is used as a romantic overture throughout the Stanley Kubrick movie Barry Lyndon and is the basis of The Christians'' 1989 single "Words". Ã“ Riada did a setting of the poetry of Thomas Kinsella, who returned the favour by praising Ã“ Riada in verse. He became involved in Irish politics and was a friend of several influential leaders[citation needed]. Ã“ Riada and Ruth both drank regularly at a local pub which still advertises itself as his being his local. He suffered cirrhosis of the liver. He was flown to King''s College Hospital, London for treatment and died there. He is buried in St Gobnait''s graveyard, Baile Bhuirne, County Cork. Willie Clancy played at his funeral.</p>\r\n<p>Two schools are named ''Scoil UÃ­ Riada'' after him: a Gaelscoil in Kilcock, Co. Kildare, and another, in Bishopstown, Cork City.</p>\r\n', '', 'Sean-o-riada.jpg', 1),

The band started off as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group, named in honour of its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves as The Dubliners. The group line-up has seen many changes over their fifty-year career. However, the group''s success was centred around lead singers Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew, both of whom are now deceased. The band garnered international success with their lively Irish folk songs, traditional street ballads and instrumentals. The band were regulars on the folk scenes in both Dublin and London in the early 1960s, until they were signed to the Major Minor label in 1965 after backing from Dominic Behan. They went on to receive extensive airplay on Radio Caroline, and eventually appeared on Top of the Pops in 1967 with hits "Seven Drunken Nights" and "Black Velvet Band". Often performing songs considered controversial at the time, they drew criticism from some folk purists and Irelandâ€™s national broadcaster RTÃ‰ had placed an unofficial ban on their music from 1967-71. During this time the band''s popularity began to spread across mainland Europe and they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in the United States. The group''s success remained steady right through the 1970s and a number of collaborations with The Pogues in 1987 saw them enter the UK Singles Chart on another two occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dubliners were instrumental in popularising Irish folk music in Europe, though they did not quite surpass the popularity of The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem in the United States. They influenced many generations of Irish bands, and their legacy can to this day be heard in the music of artists such as The Pogues, Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly. Much adored in their native country, covers of Irish ballads by Ronnie Drew and Luke Kelly tend to be regarded as definitive versions. One of the most influential Irish acts of the 20th century, they celebrated 50 years together in 2012, making them Ireland''s longest surviving musical act. Also in 2012, the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards bestowed them with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The Dubliners announced their retirement in the autumn of 2012, after 50 years of playing, following the death of founding member Barney McKenna. However, the surviving members of the group - with the exception of John Sheahan - continue touring in 2013 under the name of "The Dublin Legends".', '', 'thedubliners.jpg', 3),

Living Tradition magazine said that "This (Profiad) is the most impressive album yet from Welsh band Carreg Lafar." and "I hope....they are able to use this terrific album as a springboard to the wider audience they so obviously deserve." fRoots magazine also reviewed Profiad. "At a time when so many Welsh releases are pushing the envelope and seeking to stand in line with a wider world - all honorable and worthy aims - it''s refreshing to come right back to the core and listen to the excellence that Welsh trad, done well, can conjure. ''Profiad'' mixes a whole pile of trad vocal tracks with airs, original tunes and Meic Stevens'' epic tribute to a Merthyr labour martyr - ''Dic Penderyn''. The band are sharp, their playing by turn breathily atmospheric, or paced and driving. Vocalist Linda Owen Jones carries all before her in splendid fashion, especially effective on the close harmony, ''Y Dryw Bach'', which steams into the title track - fiddle, flute and pipes weaving a tight mattress for further lyrical wonder and a marvellously spirited Balkan close. Probably the track with most gravity though, is ''Dic Penderyn''. Its blend of airy melody and doomed atmosphere bears out the promise that here is a band on the cusp of something rather big."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current line up still includes four of the original band members, Linda Owen Jones (voice), Rhian Evan Jones (fiddle) James Rourke (flute and whistles) and Antwn Owen Hicks (voice, pibgorn, bagpipes and whistle).

(24, 'Yn Chruinnaght', 'man', 'Yn Chruinnaght is a cultural festival in the Isle of Man which celebrates Manx music, Manx language and culture, and links with other Celtic cultures.</p>\r\n<h3>Origin and history</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The forerunner of Yn Chruinnaght was founded in 1924, and was known as Cruinnaght Vanninagh Ashoonagh ("Manx national gathering"). It was the idea of William Cubbon, the first director of the Manx Museum, who was also the Honorary Treasurer of both Yn Ã‡heshaght Ghailckagh (The Manx Gaelic Society) and the World Manx Association (WMA).</p>\r\n<p>Programmes from the early festivals state that "Yn Cruinnaght Vanninagh Ashoonagh is held under the auspices of The World Manx Association and The Manx [Gaelic] Society in commemoration of our great National Poet and with the object of preserving national sentiment." The "great National Poet" referred to is Thomas Edward Brown (1830â€“1897) whose poems, including lengthy verse-stories in Manx dialect (of English, though with some Gaelic words), were published by Macmillan.</p>\r\n<p>The Cruinnaght Vanninagh Ashoonagh was organised by William Cubbon through the WMA''s Ellan Vannin magazine, which he edited. The festival was a one-day, competitive event held at Hollantide, with participants from the Island (though at least one of the judges, Dr J E Lyon, came from across (i.e. from outside the Island)). Members of the various sub-committees included Archibald Knox, J J Kneen and Mona Douglas. The event included singing (including in the Manx Gaelic language), music (including a grand concert as a finale), arts, crafts and cookery. The festival came to an end with the outbreak of the Second World War.</p>\r\n<h3>Post-war revival</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the aim of one of the leading figures in Manx traditional cultural affairs, Mona Douglas, to revive Yn Chruinnaght as a Manx national festival. A cultural revival starting in the late 1960s led to renewed vigour in the Manx language, traditional music, and particularly in Manx dancing. Mona recognised that Yn Chruinnaght could provide a focus for cultural activities and a way to give greater recognition to Manx traditional culture, particularly in the wider context of an inter-Celtic festival.</p>\r\n<p>In 1977, Mona Douglas organised Feailley Vanninagh Rhumsaa (the "Ramsey Manx Festival") which was held on 1 September in collaboration with the Ellynyn ny Gael (Arts of the Gaels) organization. The programme''s front cover bore the modern symbol of Yn Chruinnaght. The programme announced that the festival "will be revived in Ramsey Augustâ€“September 1978, and this time it will be a five-day Inter-Celtic Festival". It was held on 21â€“25 August 1978. Mona Douglas''s programme note in 1979 states that "It was decided to stage Yn Chruinnaght in Ramsey, the only town in the Island which had no important festival of its own, and which, like Peel, was a recognized centre of the national revival."</p>\r\n<h3>Inter-Celtic festival</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas Cruinnaght Vanninagh Ashoonagh had been a festival only of Manx culture, Mona Douglas conceived Yn Chruinnaght in its modern form as an inter-Celtic festival, giving an opportunity for the six Celtic nations of the Isle of Man, Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall to participate. Mona Douglas was particularly pleased to receive official recognition for Yn Chruinnaght from Oireachtas na Gaeilge in Ireland, Yr Orsedd y Beirdd and Yr Eisteddfod Genedlaethol in Wales and An Mod in Scotland.</p>\r\n<p>Events have been held throughout the Island as part of Yn Chruinnaght, but the main focus from 1978 to 2006 was the town of Ramsey. The relationship of Yn Chruinnaght with Ramsey has been an important factor over the years. The festival enjoyed venues and facilities throughout the town, including a variety of hotels and the Town Hall, various churches and even the livestock mart. As many of these venues and facilities ceased to be available, a marquee became a feature of the festival. However, with the usual plot in Ramsey for a marquee no longer available in 2007, Yn Chruinnaght had to reconsider its siting. In 2007, the main focus moved to the Centenary Centre in Peel.</p>\r\n<p>The development of traditional arts in the Isle of Man has continued apace since the late 1960s. Mona Douglas recognised that the energy associated with it could be harnessed to revive Yn Chruinnaght. Further development would undoubtedly have taken place in its own way. However, Yn Chruinnaght has provided a focus for thinking about and arranging traditional music, and has been the spur for new creative work drawing on traditional themes.</p>\r\n', 'http://www.ynchruinnaght.com/', 'Logo_yn_Chruinnaght.jpg', 2),

Out of the ashes of Rick & The Hayseeds the band came to be known as The Onyx Set, named after an Onyx ring owned by original band member Mike Black-Borow. After various changes in the line-up they shortened their name to The Onyx and the classic line-up was formed. The band members were: guitarist Alan Hodge, who had previously played with various local bands such as The Buccaneers and The Fabulous Jaguars, vocalist Tony Priest, bassist Dick Bland, keyboard player Steve Cotton and drummer Roger Dell.</p>\r\n<p>The Onyx were and still remain, one of the biggest bands to come out of Cornwall. The band evolved from doing cover versions of popular contemporary Beat boom bands in its early days to Psychedelia. It was well known for its intricate five part harmonies. During the late 1960s they were a popular live attraction, focussing most of their gigging activity in Bristol and South Wales, as well as touring throughout the UK and making trips to Germany. They also featured on numerous Radio One sessions, resulting in the band being one of the most played bands on BBC Radio at the time. They also featured heavily on radio stations in Europe.</p>\r\n<p>They released a total of seven singles, one of which was released under the pseudonym. Salamander. Oddly, it had been hoped that a change in the band''s name would help distance them from their Radio One work and increase record sales. Most of the A sides of the singles were written by Guy Fletcher and Doug Flett with the B sides credited to the members of the band. They are also credited as the writers on the single. "Climb That Tree", which was recorded by The She Trinity in 1970, as well as writing "I''m Going Down" for Mike Raynor & Sky.</p>\r\n<p>Hodge left the band in the late 1970 to get married and return to Cornwall, leaving just prior to the release of "Our House". The band continued as The Onyx with a new guitarist, Bernie Lee from Paper Blitz Tissue and Orange Bicycle, releasing one final single "The Next Stop Is Mine".</p>\r\n<p>Under the guidance of Jerry Lordan, the band emerge shortly afterwards as Vineyard releasing two singles on Decca and Deram. Original drummer Dell left the band to be replaced by Herman Rarebell (later of The Scorpions). Vineyard recorded a number of tracks for a possible LP release, but with poor singles sales these tracks would remain unreleased.
